Due to this, I had researched\n          the concept a bit in the past but have not put a whole lot of thought\n          into recently … that is until today. Today was an interesting day as I\n          started receiving messages from my portfolio website en masse. It\n          turns out someone was attempting to use my contact form to try an SQL\n          injection attack. This in an of itself was not much of a concern as I\n          did not have any sort of database being used with my portfolio\n          website, but I was planning on building a few blog websites in the\n          near future that I would need to use a database with. So how would I\n          ensure that these websites are safe from this sort of attack that\n          already attempted to make me another one of its’ victims?\n        </p>\n        <img\n          src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598439210625-5067c578f3f6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1172&q=80\"\n          alt=\"Penguin Test\"\n          style={{ height: \"100px\", objectFit: \"contain\" }}\n        />\n        <p>\n          First I decided I needed to look into getting a better understanding\n          of what an SQL injection attack was, and what vulnerability it was\n          taking advantage of. In a very basic nutshell, SQL injections take\n          advantage of the fact that un-secure queries can have addition SQL\n          statements added into the query throw user input fields.\n        </p>\n        <p>For example,</p>\n        <p>\n          <code>\n            let query = “SELECT * FROM userTable WHERE userName = “ +\n            passed_in_field;\n          </code>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If an attacker was to pass in “<code>notARealUsername OR 1=1</code> ”\n          for the user_name field, the database would receive the query …{\" \"}\n          <code>\n            “SELECT * FROM userTable WHERE userName = notARealUsername OR 1=1”\n          </code>{\" \"}\n          , which is a valid query, and would result in the database returning\n          every entry in the userTable table since <code>‘1=1’</code> would\n          result in TRUE for every row.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          That is a scary thing that can happen, but it can also be much worse\n          if the attacked is able to determine the names of your tables, then\n          they could also do{\" \"}\n          <code>“notARealUsername OR 1=1; DROP specificTable”</code>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In order to prevent these injections of SQL statements, we need to\n          figure out how to separate our SQL statements from user inputs. We do\n          this by utilizing ‘Parameterized Queries’.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Additionally, we should add in some validation to ensure that what we\n          are receiving is what we would be expecting. For example, if we are\n          expecting an email, we could validate it is an email containing ‘@’\n          and ‘.com’ for example or that it does not contain symbols such as =\n          or ; which would not be in a valid email but could be in an SQL\n          injection.\n        </p>\n      </>\n    ),\n    image:\n      \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509479200622-4503f27f12ef?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1169&q=80\",\n    author: \"Nicholas Kempkes\",\n    date: \"07/24/2023\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    title: \"AI from a Junior Developer's Perspective\",\n    summary: `As a junior software engineer, the concept of SQL injection attacks\n    had been taught to me when I was first learning databases, but how to\n    deal with them was not really taught.
